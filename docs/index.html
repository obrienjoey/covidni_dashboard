**Covid 19 Northern Ireland Dashboard**

This dashboard provides an overview of the latest data regarding the 2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) outbreak in Northern Ireland. The data is updated every day to incorporate the most recent statistics via an additional piece of software hosted [here](https://github.com/obrienjoey/covid19northernireland). The dashboard itself is implemented in the `R` programming language, specifically using the `flexdashboard` package within an `Rmarkdown`framework. 

**Packages**

* Dashboard interface - the [`flexdashboard`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) package. 
* Visualization - the [`plotly`](https://plot.ly/r/) package for the plots and [`mapview`](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/) package for the map.
* Data manipulation - [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).
* Tables - the [`DT`](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) package.
